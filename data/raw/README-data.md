# Overview {#overview}

This readme describes the dataset for the following paper:

Aulsebrook, Jacques-Hamilton, & Kempenaers (2023) Quantifying mating behaviour using accelerometry and machine learning: challenges and opportunities. Animal Behaviour, 2023

Dataset available at <https://edmond.mpdl.mpg.de/privateurl.xhtml?token=3c5da533-d851-4988-994c-f984c5f1b1a4>

Scripts to accompany the analysis are available at <https://github.com/rowanjh/behav-acc-ml>

The dataset includes two zip files, `raw-data-db.zip`, and `raw-data-other.zip`, described below

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# raw-data-db.zip {#raw-data-db.zip}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This zip contains an sqlite3 database 'ruff-acc.db' approx 80GB in size. This database has 30 raw accelerometery recordings from captive Ruffs. Each recording contains approximately 5-8 days of raw accelerometer data sampled at 50Hz.

Raw accelerometer data from loggers were converted to csv using software from the accelerometer manufacturers. Raw csv files were subsequently imported into an sqlite3 database. Original csv files are not released in the public dataset.

### ruff-acc.db: acc table

This table contains raw accelerometer data from deployments on Ruffs. Each row represents a single accelerometer sample (with one sample every 0.02 seconds). Datetime is derived from the accelerometer clock, so is subject to clock drift and may not align with standard time. There is a multicolumn index on recording_id and datetime.

| Column       | Description                                |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------|
| recording_id | unique ID code for accelerometer recording |
| datetime     | sample datetime (in fractional seconds)    |
| accx         | sample x-axis acceleration of sample       |
| accy         | sample y-axis acceleration of sample       |
| accz         | sample z-axis acceleration of sample       |

### ruff-acc.db: recordings table

This table is a simple reference for the recording ID codes. Simplified `id` codes are used in the acc table to reduce storage requirements, which are here matched to the full `recording_id` used in other data sources throughout the project.

| Column       | Description                                                  |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| id           | unique code representing recording ID in the 'acc' table.    |
| recording_id | the full recording ID (matches logger_deployment_notes.csv)  |
| filename     | source file used for database import (not in public dataset) |

### 6O_calibration_files {#6o_calibration_files}

This directory contains .csv files with raw accelerometer data recorded during 6-orientation (6O) calibration. Recordings are at 50Hz, and each row represents a single sample (one row per 0.02 second interval). Times are derived from the accelerometer clock, so are subject to clock drift and may not align with standard time. Additional information about each accelerometer recording is given in `calibration_recordings_6O_Apr2022.csv`. Filenames have the following format:

`[accelerometer model]_[accelerometer ID]_[start date of recording]_[start time of recording]_[sampling rate in hz][max acceleration in gs][resolution setting of accelerometer]_6O_S1, e.g. axy4.5_L24_2022-4-19_171111_50Hz16g10bit_6O_S1`.

Each accelerometer file contains the following columns:

| Column    | Description                                             |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| TagID     | unique identifier for each recording (same as filename) |
| Date      | date of accelerometer sample                            |
| Time      | time of accelerometer sample (fractional seconds)       |
| accX      | x-axis acceleration of accelerometer sample             |
| accY      | y-axis acceleration of accelerometer sample             |
| accZ      | z-axis acceleration of accelerometer sample             |
| Temp (?C) | Accelerometer temperature, unusued column, usually NA.  |
