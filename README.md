# Quantifying mating behaviour using accelerometry and machine learning

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the repository for: "Quantifying mating behaviour using accelerometry and machine learning: challenges and opportunities" *Unpublished manuscript*

# Overview

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This analysis uses accelerometry data and machine learning techniques to classify 13 behaviours in captive male shorebirds (Ruffs; *Calidris pugnax*). An end-to-end analysis is presented, including:

1.  Calibration and time synchronisation of raw accelerometer data
2.  Windowing data & feature extraction
3.  Training hidden Markov models, random forests, and neural networks
4.  Evaluating model performance

## Instructions

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Copy repository with `git clone https://github.com/rowanjh/behav-acc-ml.git`, or download a zip.
2.  Open project
3.  Open script `run.R`. This script gives the overview of all analyses and is the starting point.

## Notes

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project uses renv for R package management. Any clone of this project will, when first launched, configure itself to use the appropriate version renv as long as the `renv.lock`, `.Rprofile`, and `renv/activate.R` files are in the project. Then run `renv::restore()` to install all of the correct packages.

To run neural networks we recommend a setting up a conda environment and using a GPU (see `/scripts/r/py/main.py` for all instructions).

Some parts of the analysis use parallel loops and can have high memory requirements. Use fewer parallel workers to reduce the memory footprint.

## Project Structure

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   `scripts/` contains all code for analyses
-   `data/raw` contains all raw accelerometer and behavioural data
-   `data/clean` contains calibrated, time-synchronised data with labels
-   `data/windowed` contains the full windowed dataset with summary features for each window
-   `outputs` contains model results, exploratory plots, and intermediate outputs
