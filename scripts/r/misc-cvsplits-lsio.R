# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Script overview ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~----
#' Aulsebrook, Jacques-Hamilton, & Kempenaers (2023) Quantifying mating behaviour 
#' using accelerometry and machine learning: challenges and opportunities.

#'
#' Purpose: 
#'       This script is used to  explore and create cross-validation folds for 
#'       the 'leave some individuals out' (LSIO) splitting method. 
#' 
#' Notes:
#'       In LSIO, all the data for a given bird is assigned to the same cross-
#'       validation fold. We made 10 folds. 
#'       
#'       In this study there were 15 birds with behaviour scored. 10 had 
#'       continuous scoring, so tended to have examples of most behavioural 
#'       classes. Five birds only received scoring during a supplementary scan
#'       through video data that was specifically  targeting copulation 
#'       attempts and mountings. Therefore they have a much smaller sample size, 
#'       and low diversity of behaviours available. The 10 thoroughly scored 
#'       birds were each assigned to a different fold, and then the five 
#'       remaining birds were assigned to one of those folds in a way that 
#'       balanced the class distributions as well as possible. 
#'

# Only 6 individuals had any copulation attempt, and most of the copulation 
# attempts were from just 3 birds. I split all of these across different folds, 
# then balanced mounting/being mounted as well as possible. Making these 
# decisions was a manual process with a bit of trial and error.
