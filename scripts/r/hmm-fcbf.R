# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Script overview ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~----
#' Aulsebrook, Jacques-Hamilton, & Kempenaers (2023) Quantifying mating behaviour 
#' using accelerometry and machine learning: challenges and opportunities.
#' 
#' github.com/...
#'
#' Purpose: 
#'      This script implements FCBF feature selection for hidden markov models.
#'      FCBF is run on folds with variable thresholds so that 15 features are 
#'      selected. Having an equal number features per fold simplifies the HMM 
#'      implementation, but 
#' 
#' Notes:
#'      Room to improve the efficiency of this process, but it gets the job done
#' 
#' Date Created: 
#'      May 2, 2023
#'      
#' Outputs:
#'      the selected features for each fold are expored to:
#'      ./config/hmm-fcbf-spec.csv
